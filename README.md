**GTA V Online - SessionSweeper**

This fork was made because the Dysanix's Dropbox link was broke. All I did was install Visual Studio, build the application, and do a quick test to see if it worked.

Press *Pause/Break* to disconnect from everyone in your current session and be alone.<br>
Press *Scroll Lock* to toggle lock your current session and stop people from joining.<br>

**Requirements for Session Locking:**<br>
[1] Windows Firewall needs to be enabled.<br>
[2] You need to run SessionSweeper as Administrator, so it can edit Firewall rules.<br>
[3] Everyone in your session needs to have SessionSweeper's session lock enabled to work if you are not alone.<br>
<br>
**Will I get banned for using this?**<br>
**No,** process suspension and firewall blockage can happen on any normal computer.<br>
